RBI MASTER DIRECTION – RECOVERY AGENTS AND GUIDELINES FOR DEBT COLLECTION
=========================================================================

CLAUSE RBI-REC-01: PERMITTED CALLING HOURS
Recovery agents and banks are strictly prohibited from calling borrowers before 8:00 AM 
and after 7:00 PM local time. Any communication made outside these hours constitutes a 
violation of RBI Fair Practices Code and is subject to regulatory penalties.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-02: PROHIBITION ON THREATS AND INTIMIDATION
Recovery agents must not use threats of violence, physical intimidation, or coercive 
language of any kind. Statements implying harm to the borrower, their family, or their 
property are strictly prohibited. Agents must maintain a respectful tone at all times.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-03: PROHIBITION ON ABUSIVE LANGUAGE
The use of obscene, profane, abusive, or derogatory language directed at borrowers or 
their associates is strictly prohibited. Agents must use professional and courteous 
language throughout all interactions.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-04: NO PHYSICAL THREATS OR HOME VISIT THREATS
Recovery agents are not permitted to threaten unannounced home visits, office visits, 
or any form of physical confrontation as a collection tactic. Threatening to send a 
recovery team to the borrower's residence without legal due process is a direct violation.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-05: NO FALSE LEGAL REPRESENTATIONS
Agents must not falsely represent that nonpayment will result in immediate arrest, 
imprisonment, or criminal prosecution. Misrepresenting the legal consequences of debt 
default—including mentioning police action, court summons, or jail—without proper legal 
proceedings is prohibited.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-06: PROHIBITION ON CONTACTING FAMILY OR EMPLOYER
Recovery agents may not contact the borrower's family members, spouse, children, 
relatives, or employer for the purpose of debt collection without explicit written consent 
from the borrower. Sharing debt information with third parties constitutes a privacy breach.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-07: NO SOCIAL SHAMING
Agents must not threaten to share information about the borrower's debt with neighbors, 
workplace colleagues, social media, or community members. Any form of social shaming as 
a debt collection tactic is strictly prohibited.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-08: DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS
At the start of every call, agents must clearly disclose: (a) their name, (b) the name 
of the organization they represent, and (c) the purpose of the call. Failure to provide 
this disclosure is a violation of transparency requirements.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-09: RECORDING AND CONSENT
All debt collection calls must be recorded with the borrower's knowledge. Agents must 
inform the borrower that the call may be recorded for quality and compliance purposes.

CLAUSE RBI-REC-10: ESCALATION PROCEDURES
In case of a disputed transaction or complaint from the borrower, agents must immediately 
escalate the matter to a senior compliance officer and suspend collection activities until 
the dispute is resolved. Continuing collection calls during an active dispute is prohibited.
