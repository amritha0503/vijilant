NBFC FAIR PRACTICES CODE – DEBT COLLECTION GUIDELINES
======================================================

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-01: TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION
All NBFCs and their agents must communicate transparently with borrowers. Agents must 
not make misleading statements about interest rates, outstanding balances, fees, or 
legal consequences. All information provided must be accurate and verifiable.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-02: NO MISLEADING STATEMENTS
Agents are prohibited from making misleading statements about the borrower's account, 
payment terms, or the legal status of the debt. This includes exaggerating outstanding 
amounts, inventing fees not specified in the loan agreement, or misrepresenting the 
authority of the recovery agent.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-03: PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION
NBFCs must ensure that customer financial information is kept strictly confidential. 
Recovery agents must not discuss the customer's debt, account details, or personal 
information with unauthorized third parties. Disclosure of customer financial data 
to anyone other than the authorized account holder is a violation.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-04: CUSTOMER GRIEVANCE REDRESSAL
Every NBFC must have a documented grievance redressal mechanism. If a customer raises 
a complaint or dispute during a collection call, the agent must acknowledge the complaint, 
provide a complaint reference number, and immediately escalate to the grievance officer. 
Collection activities must be paused during active dispute resolution.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-05: AGENT CONDUCT STANDARDS
Recovery agents representing NBFCs must pass a certified training program and sign a 
code of conduct. Any agent found violating fair practices guidelines must be immediately 
suspended pending an investigation. NBFCs remain liable for the conduct of their agents.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-06: FREQUENCY OF CONTACT
Recovery agents must not contact borrowers more than three times per day. Multiple 
back-to-back calls in a short period constitutes harassment and is prohibited under 
NBFC Fair Practices Code.

CLAUSE NBFC-FP-07: PAYMENT NEGOTIATION RIGHTS
Borrowers have the right to negotiate payment terms without coercion. Recovery agents 
must present payment options professionally, including restructuring plans, settlement 
options, or moratorium periods where applicable. Rejection of a payment plan request 
must be communicated in writing.
