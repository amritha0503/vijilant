INTERNAL BANK COMPLIANCE POLICIES – DEBT RECOVERY AGENTS
=========================================================

CLAUSE INTERNAL-TIME-01: OPERATING HOURS COMPLIANCE
All outbound recovery calls must be placed strictly between 8:00 AM and 7:00 PM IST 
(Indian Standard Time). Calls placed outside these hours, regardless of the customer's 
timezone, are in direct violation of both RBI guidelines and internal policy. 
Violations must be reported immediately to the compliance manager.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-VISIT-01: HOME VISIT PROHIBITION
Recovery agents are strictly prohibited from threatening unannounced home or office 
visits as a collection tactic. Any mention of "sending a team to your home", "visiting 
your residence", or "coming to your doorstep" constitutes a violation. Authorized 
home visits may only occur after written notice and legal approval from compliance.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-POLICE-01: PROHIBITION ON POLICE AND COURT MENTIONS
Agents must not mention police intervention, court summons, FIR filing, or arrest 
without prior written approval from the bank's legal department. Unilateral warnings 
about police action or criminal proceedings are prohibited and may expose the bank 
to legal liability.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-JAIL-01: PROHIBITION ON JAIL THREATS
Agents must never state or imply that the borrower will be imprisoned, jailed, or 
detained for failing to repay a debt. Civil debt in India does not result in criminal 
imprisonment, and any such statement is factually incorrect and constitutes coercion.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-EMPATHY-01: MANDATORY EMPATHETIC RESPONSE FOR FRAUD COMPLAINTS
If a customer reports an unauthorized transaction, unauthorized account debit, or fraud, 
the agent must immediately acknowledge the complaint with empathy, suspend all collection 
activity on the disputed amount, and escalate to the fraud investigation team within 
15 minutes of the call. Continuing to demand payment on a disputed amount is a violation.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-FAMILY-01: NO CONTACT WITH FAMILY MEMBERS
Agents must never contact, threaten to contact, or mention contacting the borrower's 
family members (spouse, parents, children, siblings) for the purpose of debt recovery. 
Any reference to family contact is a violation of privacy policy and RBI guidelines.

CLAUSE INTERNAL-RECORD-01: MANDATORY CALL RECORDING
All recovery calls must be recorded and stored for a minimum of 180 days. Agents must 
inform the customer at the start of the call that the conversation is being recorded. 
Failure to record or inform constitutes a compliance violation.
